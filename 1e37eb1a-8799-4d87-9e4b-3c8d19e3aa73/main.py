**Adaptive Time-Series Forecasting**
```python
# Conceptual implementation
def build_forecast_model(ticker_data, lookback_window=60, forecast_horizon=5):
    # Feature engineering
    features = engineer_features(ticker_data, lookback_window)
    
    # Detect current market regime
    regime = detect_market_regime(ticker_data)
    
    # Select appropriate model based on regime
    if regime == "trending":
        model = LSTMModel(lookback_window, forecast_horizon)
    elif regime == "mean_reverting":
        model = MeanReversionModel(lookback_window, forecast_horizon)
    elif regime == "volatile":
        model = EnsembleModel([LSTMModel, TransformerModel, GBMModel], weights=[0.3, 0.4, 0.3])
    
    # Train with appropriate hyperparameters for the regime
    hyperparams = get_regime_specific_hyperparams(regime)
    model.train(features, hyperparams)
    
    return model
```

**Statistical Arbitrage Engine**
```python
# Conceptual implementation
def identify_arbitrage_opportunities(universe, lookback_period=30):
    # Build correlation matrix
    correlation_matrix = build_correlation_matrix(universe, lookback_period)
    
    # Identify highly correlated pairs
    cointegrated_pairs = []
    for pair in itertools.combinations(universe, 2):
        if is_cointegrated(pair[0], pair[1], lookback_period):
            cointegrated_pairs.append(pair)
    
    # Calculate z-scores for pairs
    opportunities = []
    for pair in cointegrated_pairs:
        z_score = calculate_pair_zscore(pair[0], pair[1], lookback_period)
        if abs(z_score) > Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD:
            opportunities.append({
                "pair": pair,
                "z_score": z_score,
                "direction": "short" if z_score > 0 else "long"
            })
    
    return opportunities
```

**Sentiment Analysis**
```python
# Conceptual implementation
def analyze_sentiment(ticker, lookback_days=3):
    # Collect news articles, social media posts, analyst reports
    news_data = collect_news_data(ticker, lookback_days)
    social_data = collect_social_data(ticker, lookback_days)
    analyst_data = collect_analyst_data(ticker, lookback_days)
    
    # Process with NLP models
    news_sentiment = bert_sentiment_model.predict(news_data)
    social_sentiment = bert_sentiment_model.predict(social_data)
    analyst_sentiment = bert_sentiment_model.predict(analyst_data)
    
    # Weight and combine sentiment scores
    combined_sentiment = (
        0.4 * news_sentiment + 
        0.3 * social_sentiment + 
        0.3 * analyst_sentiment
    )
    
    # Calculate sentiment momentum
    sentiment_momentum = calculate_sentiment_momentum(ticker, lookback_days)
    
    return {
        "sentiment_score": combined_sentiment,
        "sentiment_momentum": sentiment_momentum
    }
```

### Risk Management

**Volatility-Based Position Sizing**
```python
# Conceptual implementation
def calculate_position_size(ticker, forecast, account_value):
    # Calculate forecast confidence
    confidence = calculate_forecast_confidence(forecast)
    
    # Estimate volatility (use GARCH or other advanced volatility models)
    volatility = estimate_volatility(ticker)
    
    # Calculate Kelly Criterion with dampening factor
    kelly_fraction = calculate_kelly(forecast, confidence)
    dampened_kelly = kelly_fraction * DAMPENING_FACTOR
    
    # Calculate dollar value of position
    position_dollars = account_value * dampened_kelly
    
    # Apply volatility-based adjustment
    volatility_adjustment = 1 / (1 + volatility/VOLATILITY_BASELINE)
    adjusted_position = position_dollars * volatility_adjustment
    
    # Apply maximum position size constraints
    max_position = account_value * MAX_POSITION_SIZE
    final_position = min(adjusted_position, max_position)
    
    return final_position
```

**Dynamic Stop-Loss System**
```python
# Conceptual implementation
def calculate_stop_loss(ticker, entry_price, position_type, volatility_factor=1.5):
    # Calculate historical volatility
    volatility = calculate_atr(ticker, period=14)
    
    # Set initial stop based on volatility
    if position_type == "long":
        stop_price = entry_price - (volatility * volatility_factor)
    else:  # short position
        stop_price = entry_price + (volatility * volatility_factor)
    
    # Apply regime-specific adjustments
    market_regime = detect_market_regime(ticker)
    if market_regime == "volatile":
        # Wider stops in volatile markets
        stop_adjustment = 1.5
    elif market_regime == "trending":
        # Tighter stops in trending markets
        stop_adjustment = 0.8
    else:  # mean reverting
        stop_adjustment = 1.0
    
    # Apply adjustment
    if position_type == "long":
        stop_price = entry_price - (volatility * volatility_factor * stop_adjustment)
    else:  # short position
        stop_price = entry_price + (volatility * volatility_factor * stop_adjustment)
    
    return stop_price
```
